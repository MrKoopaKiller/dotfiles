## TL;DR
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrKoopaKiller/dotfiles/HEAD/install.sh)"
```
## Overview

This repository contains my personal dotfiles, which encompass various customizations for enhancing my development environment. It includes configurations for:
- Alacritty terminal
- ZSH with auto-complete, auto-suggestions, and fzf integration
- TMUX with plugins like Resurrect and Continuum
- NeoVIM with tmux integration

## Installation

To install these dotfiles, simply run the following command:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrKoopaKiller/dotfiles/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

## Manual Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Brew installed for MacOS/Linux. If not, install it from [Brew's official website](https://brew.sh/).

To streamline package management across both MacOS and Linux, most packages are managed using Brew. The `Brewfile` contains all necessary brew packages, including some optional ones to expedite setup. To install these packages, execute:

```bash
brew bundle install
```

For Linux systems, install the packages listed in `aptfile` using the following command:

```bash
xargs sudo apt-get install -y < ${DOTDIR}/aptfile
```

### Configuring Dotfiles

The dotfiles in this repository are organized to align with the directory structure in your `$HOME` user directory.

To manage these dotfiles, I use GNU Stow, which simplifies the process of symlinking configuration files. Stow is included in the `Brewfile`. 

To set up the dotfiles, navigate to the root directory of this repository and execute:

```bash
stow .
```

This command will create the necessary symbolic links in your home directory.

## Repository Structure

- **Root files**: `install.sh`, package lists (`Brewfile`, `aptfile`), and core Zsh and Git configuration.
- **`.config/`**: Program-specific settings for Zsh, Neovim, Tmux, and Alacritty.
- **`scripts/`**: Custom utilities such as `steampipe_aws_config_gen.sh`.

## Key Configurations

- **Zsh** â€“ `.zshenv` loads Homebrew and sets Neovim as the default editor, while `.zshrc` sources themes, shared settings, and plugins like FZF and autosuggestions.
- **Neovim** â€“ `init.vim` defines editor options, key mappings, and uses `vim-plug` to install plugins such as `vim-airline`, `ALE`, and FZF integration.
- **Tmux** â€“ `tmux.conf` remaps the prefix to `Ctrl-s`, enables mouse support, and loads plugins including Resurrect, Yank, and Prefix Highlight through `tpm`.
- **Alacritty** â€“ `alacritty.toml` customizes window opacity, blur, and fonts.
- **Git** â€“ `.gitconfig` leverages conditional includes and defines numerous aliases for common Git actions.
- **Utility Script** â€“ `steampipe_aws_config_gen.sh` iterates through AWS profiles and prints Steampipe connection blocks for multiple regions.

## Next Steps

Newcomers can explore further by:

1. Learning **GNU Stow** to understand symlink-based dotfile management.
2. Exploring **Zinit** for Zsh plugin management and custom prompts.
3. Studying the **Tmux Plugin Manager (tpm)** to extend Tmux.
4. Getting familiar with **vim-plug** and the Neovim plugin ecosystem.
5. Investigating tools like **FZF** and `zoxide` to enhance the command-line experience.
